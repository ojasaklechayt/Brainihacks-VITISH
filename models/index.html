                <h1>Automatic Numberplate Recognisation System</h1>
                <p>Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) or Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) is a
                    technology that uses optical character recognition (OCR) and pattern recognition software to read
                    vehicle registration plates. ANPR systems typically use cameras to capture images of vehicle
                    registration plates, which are then processed by specialized software to extract the alphanumeric
                    characters on the plate. The extracted data can be used for a variety of applications, such as
                    identifying stolen vehicles, tracking traffic violations, or managing access to restricted areas.
                    ANPR technology has become increasingly widespread and is now commonly used by law enforcement
                    agencies, parking enforcement companies, toll operators, and other organizations that need to
                    monitor vehicle movements.</p>

                <h1>Facial Recognisation System</h1>
                <p>Facial recognition technology is a type of biometric system that uses algorithms to identify and
                    authenticate individuals based on their facial features. The technology works by analyzing and
                    comparing unique facial features, such as the distance between the eyes, nose, and mouth, to a
                    database of known faces. It can be used for a variety of applications, such as security, access
                    control, or identification.

                    Facial recognition systems typically use cameras to capture images or videos of individuals, and
                    then use complex algorithms to extract and compare facial features. The system then matches the
                    extracted features against a database of pre-registered faces to identify the person. The technology
                    has advanced significantly in recent years and can now recognize faces with a high degree of
                    accuracy, even in challenging conditions such as low light or crowded spaces.

                    While facial recognition technology has many potential benefits, such as improving security and
                    convenience, it also raises significant privacy and ethical concerns. These include issues related
                    to data protection, surveillance, and potential biases in the algorithms used.</p>
